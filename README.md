## What I learned
In this little project, I used front-end to create the user input, a button, a dropdown menu and a label, I had a bit of experience with it in a previous Flutter project, but it was my first time implementing these features in Python and using Tkinter. I also used a grid system to organize the widgets.

About back-end, the main thing I learned was how to create and access a value in a dictionary. Alongside this project, I tried solving some Leetcode questions and one of them involved the use of Hash maps, which can be implemented in Python with dictionaries! So, I'd say dictionaries were the main thing I learned in this project.
